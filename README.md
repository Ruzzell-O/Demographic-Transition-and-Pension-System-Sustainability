# Elderly-Population-Data-Trend-Analysis-Publication

The Philippine demographic landscape is undergoing a decisive shift, with the population projected to transition into an "aging society" by 2030 as those aged 60 and over exceed 10% of the total citizenry. This transition creates a systemic fiscal threat to future generations due to the increasing old-age dependency ratio, which places a heavier economic burden on a shrinking workforce to support an expanding elderly cohort. Actuarial data from 2025 indicates that recent pension reforms, while increasing immediate benefits, have accelerated the depletion of the Social Security System (SSS) fund life, now projected to expire by 2049. Future generations face a tripartite crisis: significant funding gaps in national retirement schemes, the necessity for higher tax contributions to maintain solvency, and the potential displacement of infrastructure and development spending by rising healthcare and social protection costs. Furthermore, the high prevalence of informal sector employment results in low pension coverage, forcing future workers to reconcile their own financial stability with the traditional, yet increasingly unsustainable, role of primary providers for elderly kin in the absence of robust institutional safety nets.
